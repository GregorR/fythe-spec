This is a simple implementation of spinlocks with only Cas that require no
allocation (good for monitors on objects):

(SpinLock.Init obj idx)                 => (Seq (Seq (TempSet *0 obj) (TempSet *1 obj))
                                            (MemberSet (Temp *0) (Temp *1)
                                             (Associate 0 (Member (Temp *0) (Temp *1)))
                                            )
                                           )
(SpinLock.TryLock obj idx)              => (PCas obj idx 0 1)
(SpinLock.Lock obj idx)                 => (Seq (Seq (TempSet *0 obj) (TempSet *1 obj))
                                            (While
                                             (INot (SpinLock.TryLock (Temp *0) (Temp *1)))
                                             (Yield)
                                            )
                                           )
(SpinLock.Unlock obj idx)               => (MemberSet obj idx (Associate 0 (Null)))
