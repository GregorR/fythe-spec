\newcommand{\validshpiel}[1]{Will result in the integer 1 or 0, in either case
associated with Null. If the value of the argument was created as #1, the
result will be 1, but the result 0 does not indicate that the value was not
created as #1, only that the VM can distinguish the value from #1.  A VM should
not return 1 if using the value as #1 will result in the VM crashing.}
