TPT is an object model for Fythe. TPT means Type-Parent-Table, and represents
the fact that objects in the TPT model have (at least) those members, with the
structure member serving dual purpose as the type member.  The translations for
TPT are as follows:

(TPT.NewArray sz struct)                => (Seq (Seq (TempSet *0 (PO.New (Add 2 sz) struct)) (MemberSet (Temp *0) 1 (This))) (Temp *0))
(TPT.New struct)                        => (TPT.NewArray 0 struct)
(TPT.Parent obj)                        => (Member obj 1)
(TPT.ParentSet obj val)                 => (MemberSet obj 1 val)
(TPT.Type obj idx)                      => (Member (PO.Structure obj) (Add (PO.HeaderSize) idx))
(TPT.TypeLength obj idx)                => (Sub (Length (PO.Structure obj)) (PO.HeaderSize))
(TPT.Member obj name)                   => (MGet obj 2 name)
(TPT.MemberSet obj name val)            => (MSet obj 2 val)
(TPT.Members obj)                       => (MList obj 2)
(TPT.ValidTPT obj)                      => (Seq (TempSet *0 obj) (And (IGte (Length (Temp *0)) 3) (ValidTable (Temp *0) 2)))
(TPT.ValidTPTArray obj)                 => (IGt (Length obj) 3)
(TPT.Length obj)                        => (Sub (Length obj) 3)
(TPT.Index obj idx)                     => (Member obj (Add 3 idx))
(TPT.IndexSet obj idx val)              => (MemberSet obj (Add 3 idx) val)
